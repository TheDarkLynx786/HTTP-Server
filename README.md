# HTTP-Server
An HTTP Server I made with the help of a CodeCrafters Tutorial. 

NOTE: While it is testable on Windows, IT CAN ONLY REALLY RUN ON LINUX due to the C++ libraries used. You can use any Linux distro or WSL to properly run this code.

As of yet, only the base functionality is implemented, but if I find the opportunity, I will implement compression support.

This was a very educational and fun project, and I recommend checking out more of CodeCrafter's tutorials: https://app.codecrafters.io/
